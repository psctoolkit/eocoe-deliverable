LaTeX template for the EoCoE deliverables, it compiles with `pdflatex` and `biber`.

The two lines 

\newcommand{\DeliverableNumber}{DX.Y}

\newcommand{\DeliverableTitle}{Deliverable Name}

are used to define the relevant data, which is later reused in the document.
Everyting else should be self-explanatory.
